To get any of the below working, first to into that subfolder,
then type startserver, then open a browser and use localhost:8000
as the URL.

Subfolder example: What we started with from earlier in the semester.

Here are the seven version changes we went through in class on Tuesday:

Subfolder a: Create a Scene object, pass vertices to it.
Subfolder b: Pass the normal attribute to the shader program.
Subfolder c: Create a SceneObject that has its own array of vertices.
Subfolder d: Add a depth test.
Subfolder e: Pass an animation matrix into the vertex shader.
Subfolder f: Do perspective transformation.
Subfolder g: Transform the normal.

Your homework:

(1) Starting with the code in subfolder g, change this boring geometry into a more interesting one.
(2) Now that you have the surface normal, add Phong shading into the fragment shader.
(3) For extra credit, make a really fun animation using matrix math.
(4) For extra credit, do something else really cool.  Surprise me.
